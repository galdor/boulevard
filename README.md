# Boulevard
## Project
Boulevard is an experimental reverse proxy and HTTP server. Compared to NGINX,
Boulevard is written in a memory safe language and uses ACME for automatic TLS
certificate management. Compared to Caddy, Boulevard can act as a pure layer 4
TCP proxy without having to recompile the program.

Boulevard is not released yet, and I have a long list of interesting features to
develop. Star the repository on GitHub if you are interested!

## Licensing
Boulevard is open source software distributed under the
[ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) license.

## Contributions
### Open source, not open contribution
[Similar to SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html), Boulevard is open
source but not open contribution for multiple reasons:

- It avoids potential intellectual property and licensing issues.
- It removes the burden of reviewing patches and maintaining the resulting
  code.
- It helps keeping the software focused on a clear vision.

While this might be disappointing to you, this choice helps me continue to build
and maintain Boulevard.

### Bug reporting
I am thankful for any bug report. Feel free to open issues and include as much
useful information as possible. I cannot however guarantee that I will fix every
bug.

### Ideas and feature suggestions
Ideas about current systems and suggestions for new ones are welcome, either on
GitHub discussions, on the #boulevard IRC chan on
[Libera.Chat](https://libera.chat) or by [email](mailto:nicolas@n16f.net).

You can also [hire me](mailto:nicolas@exograd.com) for support or to develop
specific features.
